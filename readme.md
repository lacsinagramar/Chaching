# CHACHING
**Chaching** is an application that allows parents to give out chores for their children to do with money value that their children can earn through money transfer once accomplished.

# THE PROBLEM
Youth are facing **financial illiteracy** because either they do not have access on the bank, or they cant maximize their access on the bank. That is why many youth do not know how to have a financial saving and they are too financially dependent to their parents.

# SOLUTION
We think that youth, us, should be educated while we are youg to avoid future genration debt. Financial literacy has been already stalled that is why many youth grow up with knowing how to save and invest money. Youth should maximize  an easier and more fun access on the bank. It's a win-win situation because youth would learn how to read what they sow, while maximizing their access on the bank. They can use the money they earned for their own.
